Jai Maa Shivani, To Pade Pranati,
Let the devotee community,
You are Katyayani, you are Kapalini,
Pranam Pad Pankaj. ... (1)

You are mother Sharla, you are mother Bimala,
Mangala Maa Tarini,
Jai Maa Birja, Kali Karalilo,
Namu has a trident. ... (2)

Who knows how you look,
The description is in the past,
Mother Kamalini, a resident of Shrikshetra,
Listen to the words of the devotee. ... (3)

Compassionate Malo, Fountain of Mercy,
Get out of here,
He is the water of Piyush, Sebi Bhakta Jan,
Blessed be the life. ... (୪)

The past is coming, the future is known,
Sin Nashini Lo Mor,
Bad cloud, remove it mother,
Minati to Sripayar. ... (5)

Who took how much, who gave how much,
There is no respect for that,
Whatever you are looking for, whether it is with me or not,
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys ..... ... (୬)

Swollen fruit juice, no reverence,
How fast,
In what worship are you, happy mother,
How to be happy. ... (୭)

How long will Mago remain silent,
We have made a silent vow,
More than half, gone mother,
My way of life. ... (୮)

In a nutshell, I'll see you later,
Hopefully,
How Tohar, Rup M. Dhurima,
Ankibu is in front of me. ... (୯)

The path goes to Sinai, Hudilo Janani,
Hope is burning now,
As long as he is alive, he will light the lamp,
So much for you,
Kare Pranati in front. ... (10)
